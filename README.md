# WaveSimulations-FFT

## Project Overview
This project focuses on simulating wave propagation on a string using the finite difference method. It includes both structured and unstructured simulations, along with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis to explore the frequency components of the waves. The simulations cover various conditions such as fixed and free boundaries, variable string tension, and real-world effects like damping.

The objective is to study wave behavior, reflection, inversion, and frequency analysis through computational methods, providing insights into the fundamental principles of wave mechanics.
